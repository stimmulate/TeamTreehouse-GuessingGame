# TeamTreehouse-GuessingGame
Project 1 for Data Analysis Tech Degree

This is my submission for the Number Guessing Game project.

I placed in the notes that I would like an Exceeds Expectations on this project, figured I would put that here as well!

This project does just as previously stated, it is a number guessing game.
The program chooses a random number between 1-100 and prompts the user to guess a number within that range until the numnber that was randomly chosen is guessed by the user!
The program throws errors for guesses containing strings that cannot be converted to an int, as well as integers that are outside of the desired range of 1-100.
The program will ask if the user would like to play another game after completion of the current one.
The program will also save the total amount of guesses per game to a list, and spit out the mean, median and mode for guesses of all games played in the current run.
